  for writing chiptune-style songs
  in c or ruby

  -$- ABOUT

  this is a small c library for sending
  chiptunes through portaudio, which is
  a rather light cross-platform audio lib.
  <http://www.portaudio.com/>

  right now i'm only including ruby
  bindings. you are welcome to contribute
  code to hook up to other languages,
  though.

  i wrote this for h-ety h.

  -$- THE IDEALS,

  -1- ASYNCHRONOUS.
      You send it a song and it plays in
      the background. You'll get an event
      when it finishes.

  -2- SMALL.
      This is just a toy, I don't want it
      to be very big and comprehensive.
      Just to play little tunes with a
      nostalgic arcade sound rather than
      the CASIO-stylings of most MIDI.

  -3- CUSTOM NOTATION.
      Someone told me about Nokring, iMelody,
      numbered musical notation and I did
      some reading. They're little languages
      for texting yourself a ringtone.

      Bloopsaphone uses a variation on RTTTL.

      Instead of commas, I use whitespace.
      A rest is simply a number. A plus sign
      moves everything up an octave. A minus
      down an octave.

      The Simpsons' Theme, for instance, would be:

        32 + c e f# 8a g e c - 8a 8f# 8f# 8f# 2g

      Which translates into:

       * a 1/32nd note rest.
       * change one octave up.
       * C quarter note.
       * E quarter note.
       * F# quarter note.
       * A eighth note.
       * G quarter.
       * E quarter.
       * C one-quarter note.
       * change one octave down.
       * A eighth.
       * Three F# eighths.
       * G half note.
